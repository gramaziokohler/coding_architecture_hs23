# Coding Architecture I: Week 09

The goal of this week is to implement simple methods to experiment with the building/facade design and learn how to create and use attractors.

The following files are useful to follow the lecture content:

- [Attractors: tiny exercise](attractors.gh)
- [Attractors: tiny exercise solution](attractors_solution.gh)
- [Building grid: tutorial 03](03-building-grid-design-explorations.gh)
