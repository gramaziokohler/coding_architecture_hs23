# Python Playground

This folder is for you to place your practice scripts, grasshopper documents
and other test files that might be useful for you during the process of learning Python.

It is only for **YOU**, and it is not intended to be submitted.

The organization of folders per week is only a suggestion,
you are free to arrange them as you like.
